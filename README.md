# data-collection---challenge
Module 11 - Data collection challenge

**BACKGROUND**

With this challenge, I continued to strengthen my core data analytics skills: collecting data, organizing and storing data, analyzing data, and visually communicating my insights.

**DELIVERABLE AND ASSOCIATED REQUIREMENTS**

**1. Scraped Titles and Previewed Text from Mars News**

a. Used automated browsing to visit the [Mars news site](https://static.bc-edx.com/data/web/mars_news/index.html).
b. Created a Beautiful Soup object and used it to extract text elements from the website.
c. Extracted the titles and previewed text of the news articles scraped. 
  * Stored each title-and-preview pair in a Python dictionary and gave each dictionary two keys: title and preview.
  * Stored all the dictionaries in a Python list.
  * Printed the list in my Jupyter notebook.
